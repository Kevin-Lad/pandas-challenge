# pandas-challenge
Description:
This is the homework challenge for week 4 of bootcamp. In this scenario, I am the data scientist for a school distrcit. My task is to help the mayor and school make decisions on budgets and priorities. The dataset includes the types and sizes of schools, the budget for the schools and the students standarized test scores. I use pandas to clean and manipulate the data and to show trends in school performance.

Code:
As part of this assignment, I was given a starter code, so the foundation is already set. Many of the lessons in class provided the syntax for the problems, as well as brainstorming session with the instructor. 

I also collaborated with a tutor for this assignment. One of the main tasks this week was to get a good understading of the groupby function. I needed some help with the syntax from my tutor to solve the groupby problems.
